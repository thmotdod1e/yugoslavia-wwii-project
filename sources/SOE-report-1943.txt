SOE (Special Operations Executive) Report, September 1943

Assessment of resistance movements in Yugoslavia:

- Chetnik forces under Mihailović increasingly passive, suspected of collaboration with Axis forces.
- Partisan forces under Tito demonstrate aggressive and effective guerrilla warfare against German and Italian occupiers.
- Recommendation: shift support to Partisans as primary resistance movement.
